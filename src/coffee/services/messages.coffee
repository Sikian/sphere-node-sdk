# Public: Define a `MessageService` to interact with the HTTP [`messages`](http://dev.sphere.io/http-api-projects-messages.html) endpoint.
# **Read-only!**
#
# _A message represent a change or an action performed on a resource (like an Order).
# Messages can be seen as a subset of the change history for a resource inside a project.
# It is a subset because not all changes on resources result in messages._
#
# Examples
#
#   service = client.messages
#   service.byId('123').fetch()
class MessageService extends BaseService

  # Internal: {String} The HTTP endpoint for `Messages`
