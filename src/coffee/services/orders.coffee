# Public: Define a `OrderService` to interact with the HTTP [`orders`](http://dev.sphere.io/http-api-projects-orders.html) endpoint.

# _An order is the final state of a cart, usually created after a checkout process has been completed._
#
# Examples
#
#   service = client.orders
#   service.byId('123').fetch()
#   .then (result) ->
#     service.byId('123').update
#       version: result.body.version

#           action: 'changeOrderState'
#           orderState: 'Complete'
#         }
